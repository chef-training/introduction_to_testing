## ChefSpec - Intro

Welcome back! In this section we will be introducing and using ChefSpec, a testing tool. As mentioned before, testing tools provide automated ways to ensure that the code we write accomplishes its intended goal. It also helps us understand the intent of our code by providing executable documentation - as tests are able to run in virtualized environments.

Imagine for a moment that you were baking in the kitchen. You were assembling your ingredients and in the rush to set up the batter, you added 1/2 cup of salt instead of 1/2 cup of sugar to your favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. You set the temperature and out came beautiful cookies that tasted horrible! The same kind of pattern can happen when we are trying to cook up our infrastructure. How could you prevent this catastrophe from happening? If you could only verify the intent of each element before it was fully deployed into the cookie. With our infrastructure, we do have this capability with a tool called ChefSpec.

ChefSpec provides a framework for performing tests on the recipes that you write. These tests fast and give you feedback fast when there are problems that need to be fixed in your cookbook. Fast feedback allows you to build cookbooks confidently because it gives you a way to exercise these cookbooks in a virtualized way. This feedback is especially important when you add functionality or refactor your recipes as it will ensure your new changes don't break the previous functionality you wrote before and depend on working tomorrow.We protect ourselves from doing the wrong thing at the point of deployment!

Similar to Chef being a Domain Specific Language (DSL) written on top of Ruby there are many other tools that use this same paradigm. ChefSpec is one such tool. ChefSpec is built on top of a DSL named RSpec. And RSpec is a testing framework that is built on top of Ruby.
